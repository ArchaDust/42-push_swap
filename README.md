# 42-push_swap
Sorting through two stacks with a limited instruction set

Grade: 92/100

This is the code as it was upon closing the project and correcting it. There are a few minor issues that I have decided to leave as-is.

This subject wasn't the most interesting to me so I didn't try getting a good enough algorithm  
It still managed well enough given how simplistic it was in concept  

I'm glad with how it turned out, I just regret forcing myself through linked list when my first implementation used two simple arrays and was working nicely. Now optimisation flags breaks the program
